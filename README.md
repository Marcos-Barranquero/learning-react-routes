# React Router v6 learning project

This project is a learning project for React Router v6. It is a simple app that allows you to protect routes and redirect users to a login page if they are not authenticated.

The authentication is simulated by hardcoding a username and role in the custom hook. The role is used to determine if the user is an admin or analyst.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

Then run `yarn dev` to start the app.

## Possible Improvements
- Use a real authentication system against a Node backend 🔑
- Use a real database to store the users and roles 🗄️
- Use a login page to get the username and password from the user 📝
- Use a real admin page to manage users and roles 📊
- Update the UI to make it look better 🎨
